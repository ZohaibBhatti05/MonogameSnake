Snake in mongame but it sucks this took like an hour


Made to test myself by trying to recreate a game armed only with the knowledge of how the game worked, but ended up becoming a learning excercise in how to perform masking/blending in Monogame. The only hard part was figuring out how to render a texture "on top" of another texture, and figuring out how to get a "looping" effect on the rainbow.
